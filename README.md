## Introduction
In this project, I have to predict loan status based on many criteria.
Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in prediction of loan status.
Using data science to generate a best machine learning model based on these criteria. The advantages of the model will then be clearly expressed so that the best possible solution can be chosen by stakeholders.

## Data Acquisition
Downloaded data from the IBM Cloud object for data analysis.

## Data Wrangling
Used Python Libraries(Pandas, NumPy) on Jupyter notebook platform for data cleaning and preprocessing.

## Data Exploration
Used Python libraries(seaborn) for data visualisation and analysis.

## Model Development
Used Supervised Machine Learning model for loan status prediction.
